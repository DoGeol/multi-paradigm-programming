## 1.4 Functional Programming with Iterables

In this section, we’ll implement the three functions—`forEach`, `map`, and `filter`—in a variety of ways. By doing so, you’ll become familiar with how to implement functions that utilize and adhere to the Iterator pattern and iteration protocol.

Here, we’ll use plain JavaScript code without TypeScript type definitions, so we can focus on manipulating iterables and iterators directly and applying a given function to each element. In Chapter 2 (“Functional Programming, Type Systems, and Lisp”), we’ll revisit these functions, add types to them, and evolve them further.

### `forEach` Function

The `forEach` function takes a function and an iterable, iterates through the iterable, and applies the function to each element. It’s a higher-order function.

##### [Code 1-35] `function forEach(f, iterable) { for...of }`

```javascript
function forEach(f, iterable) {
  for (const value of iterable) {
    f(value);
  }
}

const array = [1, 2, 3];
forEach(console.log, array);
// 1
// 2
// 3
```

This version of `forEach` uses a `for...of` loop to traverse each element in the iterable, invoking the passed-in function `f` and passing the current `value` as an argument. In the example above, we pass `console.log`, applying the effect of printing each element of the array.

##### [Code 1-36] `function forEach(f, iterable) { while }`

```javascript
function forEach(f, iterable) {
  const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();
  let result = iterator.next();
  while (!result.done) {
    f(result.value);
    result = iterator.next();
  }
}

const set = new Set([4, 5, 6]);
forEach(console.log, set);
// 4
// 5
// 6
```

This version of `forEach` manually handles iterator with a `while` loop and direct calls to the iterator’s `next()` method. Just as before, `f` is applied to each value until `done` is `true`. Because `Set` is also iterable, we can pass it to the same `forEach` function.

> Both functions behave identically in these examples, and they closely mirror how the language internally handles iteration. One small difference is that if a `for...of` loop terminates early (or if an exception occurs) and if the underlying iterator has a `return()` method, `for...of` automatically calls `return()`. While not crucial to this chapter’s discussion, it’s useful to know for a complete understanding of the language.

### `map` Function

In [Code 1-37], `map` is implemented with a generator. It uses a `for...of` loop to walk through the iterable’s values, applying the passed-in function `f` to each `value` and yielding the transformed result.

##### [Code 1-37] `function* map(f, iterable) { for...of }`

```javascript
function* map(f, iterable) {
  for (const value of iterable) {
    yield f(value);
  }
}

const array = [1, 2, 3];
const mapped = map(x => x * 2, array);
console.log([...mapped]); // [2, 4, 6]

const mapped2 = map(x => x * 3, naturals(3));
forEach(console.log, mapped2);
// 3
// 6
// 9
```

This `map` function accepts an iterable as input and returns an iterator that is also iterable, so you can use the spread operator or `for...of` to iterate over it. Consequently, it can be combined with `naturals()` (which returns an `IterableIterator`) and `forEach` (which takes an iterable as an argument).

##### [Code 1-38] `function* map(f, iterable) { while }`

```javascript
function* map(f, iterable) {
  const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();
  while (true) { // (1)
    const { value, done } = iterator.next(); // (2)
    if (done) break;                         // (3)
    yield f(value);                          // (4)
  }
}

const mapped = map(([k, v]) => `${k}: ${v}`, new Map([['a', 1], ['b', 2]]));
forEach(console.log, mapped);
// a: 1
// b: 2
```

This version also uses a generator but handles iteration with a `while (true)` loop and manual calls to `next()`. Although it looks slightly different internally, it ultimately performs the same functionality.

1. Create an infinite loop.
2. Destructure the `next()` result.
3. If `done` is `true`, break.
4. Apply `f` to `value` and yield the result.

Here, we pass a `Map` as the iterable. Since each `Map` entry is itself iterable, we can destructure `[k, v]`, and then use `forEach` to process the generated iterator.

##### [Code 1-39] `function map(f, iterable) { return { next, ... } }`

```javascript
function map(f, iterable) {
  const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();
  return { // (1)
    next() {
      const { done, value } = iterator.next();
      return done
        ? { done, value }
        : { done, value: f(value) }; // (2)
    },
    [Symbol.iterator]() { // (3)
      return this;
    }
  };
}

const iterator = (function* () { // (4)
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}());

const mapped = map(x => x * 10, iterator); // (5)

console.log([...mapped]); // [10, 20, 30]
```

1. This `map` function directly returns an `IterableIterator` object.
2. It defines a `next` method to apply `f(value)` for each value, returning it if iteration continues.
3. It also provides a `[Symbol.iterator]` method so it adheres to the iterable protocol.
4. By using an anonymous generator, an iterator is created sequentially yielding 1, 2, and 3, and then passed into `map`.
5. `map(x => x * 10, iterator)` creates an iterator prepared to multiply each element by 10.

In the end, `mapped` is an iterator that produces `[10, 20, 30]` once fully consumed by the spread operator. The call to `console.log([...mapped])` exhausts the iterator and logs the resulting array.

### `filter` Function

The `filter` function creates a new iterator containing only those elements from the given iterable that satisfy a given condition.

##### [Code 1-40] `function* filter(f, iterable) { for...of }`

```javascript
function* filter(f, iterable) {
  for (const value of iterable) {
    if (f(value)) {
      yield value;
    }
  }
}

const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const filtered = filter(x => x % 2 === 0, array);
console.log([...filtered]); // [2, 4]
```

Here in [Code 1-40], `filter` is implemented with a generator and uses a `for...of` loop to yield only those elements for which `f(value)` is truthy.

##### [Code 1-41] `function* filter(f, iterable) { while }`

```javascript
function* filter(f, iterable) {
  const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator](); // from here
  while (true) {                                // ~
    const { value, done } = iterator.next();    // ~
    if (done) break;                            // to here is the same
    if (f(value)) {
      yield value;
    }
  }
}

const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const filtered = filter(x => x % 2 === 0, array);
console.log([...filtered]); // [2, 4]
```

Comparing the `while` loop version with the `for...of` version of both `map` and `filter` shows that the external loop, including the termination condition using `done`, remains the same; only the condition logic (checking `done`) and applying `f` changes. Practicing this pattern makes it easier to implement higher-order functions in functional programming.

##### [Code 1-42] `function filter(f, iterable) { return { next, ... } }`

```javascript
function filter(f, iterable) {
  const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();
  return {
    next() {
      const { done, value } = iterator.next();
      if (done) return { done, value };   // (3)
      if (f(value)) return { done, value }; // (1)
      return this.next();                 // (2) recursive call
    },
    [Symbol.iterator]() {
      return this;
    }
  };
}

console.log(...filter(x => x % 2 === 1, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // 1 3 5
```

From [Code 1-42], the `filter` function returns an iterator object. Its `next` method implements the following logic:

1. if the predicate(`f(value)`) satisfies conditions for each element, it returns `{ done, value }`.
   - Here, `done` is `false` and `value` is the current item.
2. If not, it calls `this.next()` recursively, continuing iteration until finding a matching element or reaching the end.
3. When the underlying iterator created by the iterable is finished (`done: true`), it simply returns `{ done, value }` to signal the end.
   - In this case, `done` is `true` and `value` is `undefined`.

Because this version([Code 1-42]) of `filter` uses recursive calls instead of a loop, it looks concise and object-oriented. Also, this code supports Tail Call Optimization(TCO). For TCO to be applied, the last function call must be a recursive call that is directly returned. In this code, the structure allows TCO because the this.next() call in (2) is the last operation, meaning its result is directly returned. Although ES6 specifies TCO, it’s unfortunately not implemented in the V8 engine, so you still risk a stack overflow with very large collections.

Below are two variations that replace recursion with a `do...while` or `while` loop instead of TCO, preserving the structure and clarity while avoiding the risk of stack overflow.

##### [Code 1-42a] Converting to `do...while` or `while`

```javascript
function filter(f, iterable) {
  const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();
  return {
    next() {
      do {
        const { done, value } = iterator.next();
        if (done) return { done, value };
        if (f(value)) return { done, value };
      } while (true); // functionally similar to the recursive call
    },
    [Symbol.iterator]() {
      return this;
    }
  };
}

// A slightly more concise while version:
function filter(f, iterable) {
  const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();
  return {
    next() {
      while (true) {
        const { done, value } = iterator.next();
        if (done) return { done, value };
        if (f(value)) return { value };
      }
    },
    [Symbol.iterator]() {
      return this;
    }
  };
}
```

Since both variations enclose the logic in an infinite loop instead of recursion, they maintain a similar structure while optimizing for safety and efficiency in handling large collections. Among modern languages, both Scala and Kotlin support tail recursion optimization internally, which means such code could be expressed recursively without risking stack overflow. In Scala, you can even annotate functions with `@tailrec` to ensure full TCO in many scenarios, while Kotlin supports `tailrec` for certain patterns. These approaches resemble the method used in [Code 1-42a], which achieves the same effect by replacing recursion with a loop.

### Composing Higher-Order Functions ((()))

Let’s combine the functions we’ve written to tackle a more complex problem:

##### [Code 1-43] Composing Higher-Order Functions

```typescript
forEach(console.log,
  map(x => x * 10,
    filter(x => x % 2 === 1,
      naturals(5))));
// 10
// 30
// 50
```

The code looks somewhat nested, but this is a common style in Lisp-like languages, sometimes considered elegant. One way to read easily it is from the bottom-right to the top-left:

> “Generate `naturals(5)`, filter so that `x % 2 === 1`, then map each result to `x * 10`, and finally pass all values to `console.log`.”

In this code, `naturals(5)` creates an iterator that sequentially generates nature number from 1 to 5. `filter` takes this iterator and creates a new one that filters only odd numbers. Remember, this is a **lazy** iterator.

It is also an argument of `map`. `map` applies `x * 10` for each element and returns the result. The `map` generator yields `f(value)` for each element. `map` ultimately returns an iterator that sequentially produces [10, 30, 50].

This is passed into `forEach` which runs the function assigned to each iterator elements and then prints each value by calling `console.log`.


### A Fun Twist on `filter`

##### [Code 1-44] `function* filter(f, iterable) { [].filter() }`

```javascript
function* filter(f, iterable) {
  for (const value of iterable) {
    yield* [value].filter(f);
  }
}

const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const filtered = filter(x => x % 2 === 0, array);
console.log([...filtered]); // [2, 4]
```

This slightly whimsical version wraps each element in a single-element array, then uses `Array.prototype.filter` instead of an `if` statement. With `yield*`, if the array ends up empty, nothing is yielded; if it has one element, that element is yielded.

Even though this might look unusual, it still supports lazy evaluation and has `O(n)` complexity because each element is visited once. There’s a minor overhead of creating single-element arrays and calling `Array.prototype.filter`, but it’s negligible in most practical scenarios.

You don’t need to take this trick too seriously, but it shows how you can creatively combine the iteration protocol. It may spark new ideas for working with iterables. Hopefully, it also provides a bit of coding fun.

Up to now, we’ve seen various ways to implement `forEach`, `map`, and `filter`, as well as how to use them in conjunction with iterators and higher-order functions. In the next chapter, we’ll explore **why** the iterator design was so important from an object-oriented perspective, delving deeper into its role and benefits.
