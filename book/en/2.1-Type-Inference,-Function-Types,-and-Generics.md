## 2.1 Type Inference, Function Types, and Generics

TypeScript adds a powerful type system to JavaScript, improving code stability and readability. With TypeScript’s type inference, developers can write safe code even without explicit type declarations. High-order functions and generics allow for the implementation of complex functional programming patterns. Additionally, combining object-oriented classes with functional functions lets you write more flexible and powerful code.

### Type Inference

Type inference in TypeScript is a feature where the compiler automatically infers the types of variables, functions, expressions, and so on, even if they are not explicitly declared. This makes it possible to maintain concise code while still ensuring type safety.

#### Basic Concept of Type Inference

In the following code, `a` does not have an explicitly declared type, but TypeScript infers `a` to be of type `number` from the value `10`. Consequently, if you try to assign a value of a different type to `a` later, `a` type error occurs.

##### [Code 2-1] Basic Example

```typescript
let a = 10;
```

In a situation like [Code 2-1], there is no need to declare the type explicitly. IDEs also provide guidance on how TypeScript infers types, making both coding and maintenance more convenient.

#### Type Inference for Variables and Constants

When you declare a variable in TypeScript, the compiler infers its type from the value you initialize it with.

##### [Code 2-2] Variable Type Inference

```typescript
let message = "Hello, TypeScript!";
```

In [Code 2-2], the type of `message` is inferred to be `string` without an explicit type declaration.

Below is an example explaining how TypeScript infers the types of constants. In the following code, the comments indicate the floating type guide boxes in an IDE when hovering over `selected`.

##### [Code 2-3] Constant Type Inference

```typescript
const selected = true;
// [const selected: true]

let checked = true;
// [let checked: boolean]
```

In [Code 2-3], because `selected` is declared with `const` and cannot be reassigned, its value cannot change, so its type is inferred to be `true`. On the other hand, because `checked` is declared with let and can be reassigned, its type is inferred to be `boolean`.

#### Function Return Type Inference

TypeScript can automatically infer the return type of a function.

##### [Code 2-4] Return Type Inference

```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;
}
```

In [Code 2-4], the `add` function takes parameters of type `number` and returns a `number`. Even though we have not explicitly specified a return type, TypeScript infers from `a` and `b` that the return type is `number`.

In the same code as shown in [Code 2-5], the return type is also inferred to be `string` if you change the types of `a` and `b` to `string`.

##### [Code 2-5] Return Type Inference 2

```typescript
function add(a: string, b: string) {
  return a + b;
}
```

##### [Code 2-6] Return Type Inference 3

```typescript
function add(a: string, b: string) {
  return parseInt(a) + parseInt(b);
}
```

TypeScript recognizes that `parseInt(a)` and `parseInt(b)` return values of type `number`, so it infers each result to be `number` and concludes that the return type of `add` is `number`.

Hence, you can explicitly add a return type, which aligns with TypeScript’s type inference as shown in [Code 2-7].

##### [Code 2-7] Return Type Inference 4

```typescript
function add(a: string, b: string): number {
  return parseInt(a) + parseInt(b);
}
```

Type Inference in Object Properties

TypeScript can infer the types of properties in object literals.

##### [Code 2-8] Inferring Types of Object Properties

```typescript
let user = {
  name: "Marty",
  age: 30
};
```

In [Code 2-8], the `name` property of the `user` object is inferred as `string`, and the `age` property is inferred as `number`.

Type Inference for Function Parameters

TypeScript can infer the types of function parameters as well.

##### [Code 2-9] Function Parameter Types

```typescript
let strs = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
strs.forEach(str => console.log(str.toUpperCase())); // [str: string]
```

In [Code 2-9], TypeScript infers that `strs` is a `string[]`. Consequently, the `forEach` method can infer that the type of `str` in the arrow function is `string`, based on the element type of the `strs` array. This allows IntelliSense to suggest `toUpperCase()` and compile successfully.

I particularly like this feature of TypeScript’s type inference. Because a higher-order function infers the parameter type of the passed-in function, we can keep our arrow functions concise. It maintains type safety while preserving the brevity of arrow functions.

In this chapter, we will learn how type inference works with user-defined high-order functions in a similarly way to them.

#### Type Inference with Generics

Generics enable a single function in TypeScript to handle multiple types, thus creating functions with a high degree of polymorphism. The `identity` function, which returns the same type as the input, is a classic example of a generic function. It uses the generic type parameter `T`. This function receives an argument `arg` of type `T` and returns a value of the same type `T`.

To clarify, TypeScript determines the actual type of `T` from the argument `arg` and applies that same type as the return type while evaluating the expression that calls `identity`.

##### [Code 2-10] identity<T>

```typescript
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}

const a = identity("hi"); // [const a: "hi"] 
// Passing "hi" to identity determines T as "hi", making a's type "hi". 

const b = identity(1); // [const b: 1]
// Passing 1 to identity determines T as 1, making b's type 1.

const c = identity<string>("a"); // [const c: string]
// Explicitly specify the generic type parameter T as string, and pass "a" as the argument.
// This sets c's type to string.

const d = identity<number>(1); // [const d: number]
// Explicitly specify the generic type parameter T as number, and pass 1 as the argument.
// This sets d's type to number.

class User {}
const e = identity(new User()); // [const e: User]
// Passing an instance of User to identity determines T as User, making e's type User.

const f = identity((n: number) => n % 2 === 1); // [const f: (n: number) => boolean]
// Passing the function (n: number) => n % 2 === 1 to identity.
// TypeScript infers the function's type as (n: number) => boolean and sets f's type accordingly.
```

This example shows how the `identity` function uses generics to accept various types. The actual type of `T` is determined by the argument `arg`, and the return type is the same `T`.

Type inference in TypeScript is crucial for enhancing both code readability and safety. It lets developers maintain high productivity despite having a robust type system in place.

### Function Types and Generics

TypeScript supports functional programming by providing features such as higher-order functions, function types, and generics. First, explicitly defining a function type makes it clear what input and output types the function handles. Next, generics let you create more general-purpose functions that can support a broad range of types. Especially in higher-order functions, TypeScript infers the types of function arguments and can flexibly infer types in conjunction with other parameters.

#### Multiple Ways to Define Function Types

TypeScript offers various ways to define function types, helping you clarify a function’s signature and ensure code stability and readability.

The most straightforward approach is to specify the types of both parameters and return values in the function itself. This makes the function’s signature explicit, enhances readability, and guarantees type safety.

##### [Code 2-11] Function

```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

const result: number = add(2, 3); // 5
```

In [Code 2-11], the `add` function takes two `number` parameters and returns a `number`. By specifying the function’s signature, TypeScript can prevent type errors at call sites.

TypeScript supports function overloading, allowing multiple signatures under the same function name. This increases flexibility and enables the function to handle various input types.

##### [Code 2-12] Function Overload

```typescript
function double(a: number): number;
function double(a: string): string;
function double(a: number | string): number | string {
  if (typeof a === 'number') {
    return a * 2;
  } else {
    return a + a;
  }
}

const num: number = double(10); // 20
const str: string = double('Hi'); // 'HiHi'
```

In this example, the `double` function is overloaded to handle both `number` and `string`. The `typeof` operator serves as a runtime type guard, enabling different logic depending on whether `value` is a `number` or `string`. In TypeScript, this approach is referred to as type narrowing by a type guard.

At compile time, TypeScript also correctly infers the type within the `if` block. If `value` passes the check `typeof value === 'number'`, `a` is inferred as `number` type. Otherwise, `a` is inferred as `string` type.

Thanks to this inference, TypeScript provides type safety even before running the code.

##### [Code 2-13] Arrow Function

Arrow functions offer concise syntax and are also useful when defining function types. You can specify the parameter and return types to ensure type safety when using arrow functions.

```typescript
const multiply = (a: number, b: number): number => a * b;

const num: number = multiply(4, 5); // 20
```

In this way, explicitly specifying both parameter and return types helps ensure type safety. However, since Typescript has powerful type inference, specifying only the parameter types is sufficient.

##### [Code 2-14] Arrow Function (Type Inference)

```typescript
const multiply = (a: number, b: number) => a * b;

const num: number = multiply(4, 5); // 20
```

In [Code 2-14], we only declare the parameter types, and TypeScript infers the return type as `number`. This demonstrates how you can keep your code concise while preserving type safety.

##### [Code 2-15] Function Type Alias

```typescript
type Add = (a: number, b: number) => number;

const add: Add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

In this example, a function type alias named `Add` is defined to represent a function of the form `(a: number, b: number) => number`. Then, you can declare a function variable `add` with the type `Add`, ensuring that it is implemented accordingly. Defining a function type as an alias allows for convenient reuse wherever the same function signature is needed.

Having covered various methods for defining function types, let’s move on to how higher-order functions and generics can be used to implement more complex and flexible functional programming patterns.

#### The constant Function and Generics

The `constant` function returns a function that always yields the value passed to it. Essentially, this function captures a specific value and returns it every time the returned function is called. By implementing it as a generic, you can handle different types of values seamlessly.

##### [Code 2-16] The constant Function and Types

```typescript
function constant<T>(a: T): () => T {
  return () => a;
}

const getFive = constant(5);
const ten: number = getFive() + getFive();
console.log(ten); // 10

const getHi = constant("Hi");
const hi2: string = getHi() + getHi();
console.log(hi2); // HiHi
```

In this example, calling `constant(5)` creates a function `getFive`, which is then called twice, and the results are added together and stored in `ten`. Likewise, calling `constant("Hi")` creates a function `getHi`, which is called twice, and the results are concatenated and stored in `hi2`.

By using the `constant` function with generics, it can handle any type of value. Thanks to TypeScript’s type inference, it works correctly without needing explicit type declarations. Here is a detailed explanation:

1. By writing `<T>` next to the `constant` function, we declare that we will use a generic type `T` in this function.
2. We define the type of the parameter `a` as `T`.
3. The `constant` function accepts a value of type `T` and returns a function that returns a value of type `T`.
4. We specify the return type of the returned function as `() => T`, indicating that it takes no parameters and returns `T`.
5. Because `constant` is called with the argument 5, `T` is inferred as `number`, making the return type of `getFive` also `number`.
6. Because `constant` is called with the argument "Hi", `T` is inferred as `string`, making the return type of `getHi` also `string`.
7. By leveraging generics, the `constant` function can handle any type of value, and type inference ensures the return type of the resulting function is accurate.

> Note: Unlike the `identity` function, where passing `5` or `"Hi"` would immediately infer `T` as `number` or `string`, TypeScript tends to infer broader types when dealing with the arguments or return values of higher-order functions that manipulate first-class functions. While this detail is not critically important, it is good to keep in mind.

We have now covered the core concepts of type inference, function types, and generics. Practicing these features will help you write safer code in a multi-paradigm language like TypeScript.
