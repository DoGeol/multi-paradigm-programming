## 1.2 Generators: Building Iterators with Imperative Programming

Earlier, I mentioned that “the traditional, object-oriented Iterator design pattern is enhancing its value by meeting functional programming’s first-class functions” and “that generators, which are written in an imperative style, also mesh with this combination, allowing object-oriented, functional, and imperative paradigms to cooperate within a single language—advancing all three paradigms together and driving languages to become truly multiparadigm.”

The reason for this description is that generators let you implement and produce an iterator—based on the Iterator pattern—using imperative code. Some problems are more efficiently and intuitively solved using an imperative style. Generators provide a crucial foundation for enabling object-oriented and functional paradigms to cooperate with imperative approaches.

### Basic Generator Syntax

A generator is syntax that allows you to write iterators in an imperative style. Defined with the `function*` keyword, a generator function does not execute immediately when called; instead, it returns an iterator object. Through this object, you can externally control the function’s execution flow.

#### `yield` and `next()`

When you call the `next()` method on the iterator returned by a generator function, the generator runs until it encounters a `yield` keyword. That `yield` keyword sends a value back to the caller and then pauses the function. Calling `next()` again resumes the function from the point where it left off, continuing until it reaches the next `yield` or finishes. By combining `yield` and `next()`, you can maintain the internal state of the function and return values sequentially.

[Code 1-10] demonstrates a simple generator that yields the numbers 1 through 3 in order.

##### [Code 1-10] A Simple Generator

```typescript
function* generator() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

const iter = generator();

console.log(iter.next()); // { value: 1, done: false }
console.log(iter.next()); // { value: 2, done: false }
console.log(iter.next()); // { value: 3, done: false }
console.log(iter.next()); // { value: undefined, done: true }
```

Here, the `generator` function immediately returns an iterator object upon being called. Each time you call `iter.next()`, the generator runs until it hits a `yield` statement, returns the associated value, and suspends execution. It continues this process until the `done` property becomes `true`.

If there’s a `console.log('hi');` between `yield 1;` and `yield 2;`, it behaves as follows:

##### [Code 1-10a] Pausing Execution in a Generator

```typescript
function* generator() {
  yield 1;
  console.log('hi');
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

const iter = generator();

console.log(iter.next());
// { value: 1, done: false }
console.log(iter.next()); // hi <-- console.log('hi') runs at this point
// { value: 2, done: false }
console.log(iter.next());
// { value: 3, done: false }
console.log(iter.next());
// { value: undefined, done: true }
```

In this case, the first `iter.next()` call yields `1` and pauses execution just before `console.log('hi');`. The second `iter.next()` call triggers the `console.log('hi');` and then yields `2`. The generator continues this pattern until `done` becomes `true`.

#### Generators and Control Statements

Because generators use an imperative approach, you can use constructs like conditionals within them:

##### [Code 1-11] Using Conditionals in a Generator

```typescript
function* generator(condition: boolean) {
  yield 1;
  if (condition) {
    yield 2;
  }
  yield 3;
}

const iter1 = generator(false);

console.log(iter1.next()); // { value: 1, done: false }
console.log(iter1.next()); // { value: 3, done: false }
console.log(iter1.next()); // { value: undefined, done: true }
```

In [Code 1-11], the first call to `iter1.next()` returns `1` and pauses the function. On the second call, because `condition` is `false`, `yield 2;` is skipped, and `3` is returned immediately.

If you pass `true`, the second yield is executed as well:

##### [Code 1-11a] Using Conditionals in a Generator

```typescript
const iter2 = generator(true);

console.log(iter2.next()); // { value: 1, done: false }
console.log(iter2.next()); // { value: 2, done: false }
console.log(iter2.next()); // { value: 3, done: false }
console.log(iter2.next()); // { value: undefined, done: true }
```

In this way, you can use `if` statements within a generator to control the logic that produces elements for the iterator.

#### The `yield*` Keyword

The `yield*` keyword lets a generator function iterate through another iterable object, sequentially yielding the elements it provides. In TypeScript, an iterable is "an object that supports iteration," such as an array `[2, 3]`. This means you can traverse it not only with `for...of` loops and the spread operator (`...`) but also with `yield*`. We’ll delve deeper into iterables in Section 1.3.

Here’s a simple example of using `yield*` to iterate through an array of two elements:

##### [Code 1-12] A Generator Using `yield*`

```typescript
function* generator() {
  yield 1;
  yield* [2, 3];
  yield 4;
}

const iter = generator();

console.log(iter.next()); // { value: 1, done: false }
console.log(iter.next()); // { value: 2, done: false }
console.log(iter.next()); // { value: 3, done: false }
console.log(iter.next()); // { value: 4, done: false }
console.log(iter.next()); // { value: undefined, done: true }
```

Here’s how the `generator` function works:

1. The first call to `iter.next()` runs `yield 1`, returning `1` and pausing.
2. The second call triggers `yield* [2, 3]`, which sequentially yields each element from `[2, 3]`—like doing `yield 2;` and then pausing, followed by `yield 3;`.
3. The third call resumes from where it left off, returning `3` (equivalent to `yield 3;`).
4. The fourth call yields `4`.
5. Subsequent calls return `done: true`.

#### `naturals`

The following generator creates an infinite sequence of natural numbers, starting at 1. It uses a `while(true)` loop with `yield` to produce numbers one by one.

##### [Code 1-13] `naturals`

```typescript
function* naturals() {
  let n = 1;
  while (true) {
    yield n++;
  }
}

const iter = naturals();

console.log(iter.next()); // { value: 1, done: false }
console.log(iter.next()); // { value: 2, done: false }
console.log(iter.next()); // { value: 3, done: false }
// You can keep calling iter.next() indefinitely.
```

Although the `naturals` generator function uses an infinite loop, it only produces a new number when `iter.next()` is called, so your process or browser won’t freeze. As mentioned before, iterators are lazy. Generators also return an iterator and only run as far as `next()` calls take them. Thus, generators, too, support lazy evaluation—in other words, they defer code execution until needed.

### Rewriting `reverse` with Generators

In the following example, we’ll recreate the `reverse` function from [Code 1-5]—which returned an `Iterator`—using a generator:

##### [Code 1-14] `reverse` with a Generator

```typescript
function* reverse<T>(arrayLike: ArrayLike<T>): IterableIterator<T> {
  let idx = arrayLike.length;
  while (idx--) {
    yield arrayLike[idx];
  }
}

const array = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'];
const reversed = reverse(array);

console.log(reversed.next().value); // F
console.log(reversed.next().value); // E
console.log(reversed.next().value); // D
```

This `reverse` function starts from the end of `arrayLike` and moves backwards to `0`, yielding each element in turn. You can traverse the elements by calling `next()` on the returned generator, just like before. While the implementation differs from [Code 1-5], the behavior is the same. In [Code 1-5], we built an object containing a `next()` method that uses the `idx` state; in [Code 1-14], we wrote imperative code with a loop. Both solve the same problem.

This example underscores a broader point about modern programming languages: you can often solve a given problem in multiple ways—object-oriented, imperative, or functional. Throughout this chapter and beyond, we’ll continue to implement iterators for iterable objects using OOP, imperative, and functional styles, examining how these three approaches remain compatible. We’ll also dig deeper into how they work in concert to push multiparadigm languages forward.
