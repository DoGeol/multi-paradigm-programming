## 2. Functional Programming, Type Systems, and Lisp

Programming paradigms and languages are constantly evolving. Today, we live in an era of multiparadigm languages, where object-oriented, functional, and imperative paradigms coexist. Among these, the functional paradigm helps write predictable and readable code through concepts like immutability, pure functions, higher-order functions, and lazy evaluation. These functional techniques are being adopted by more and more languages, including JavaScript and TypeScript.

In this chapter, we will delve into the core principles of functional programming and explore how TypeScript’s type system supports them. We’ll learn how to leverage type inference, higher-order functions and function types, generics, and other type features to write safer, more maintainable code. We’ll also look at how to combine object-oriented classes and functional functions effectively.

Additionally, we’ll examine some core ideas from **Lisp**, often considered the root of functional programming. Lisp’s unique approach of treating code itself as list-structured data enables flexible and powerful metaprogramming. Many of Lisp’s ideas have profoundly influenced modern multiparadigm languages, and JavaScript and TypeScript likewise incorporate key concepts that can be traced back to Lisp.

By the end of this chapter, you’ll understand how functional programming interacts with a type system, as well as the charm and elegant philosophy behind Lisp. Building on this foundation, we’ll explore how to write safer, more efficient, and more readable code.
