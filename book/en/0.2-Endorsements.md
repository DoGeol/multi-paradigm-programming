## Endorsements

> New tools and methodologies in software development emerge almost every day. However, in our pursuit of the new, we often overlook the value of what we already have. Indong’s new book re-examines the powerful features that modern programming languages already possess and shows how to maximize their potential. Since major languages like Java, C#, TypeScript, and Kotlin now support multiple paradigms, we can take advantage of various programming paradigms within a single language. This book accurately captures this shift and provides detailed guidance on how to leverage it in real-world projects.
>
> What impressed me the most while reading was Indong’s keen insight into the “essence of code.” Watching him elegantly solve complex business logic with the iterable protocol and list processing, and handle tricky asynchronous operations with lazy evaluation and generators, only reaffirmed my belief that this is quintessential Indong. It’s like watching a master craftsperson expertly wield their tools. Having worked with him, I’ve often heard him stress elegant code and writing less of it; this core principle permeates every page of the book.
>
> One particularly notable strength of this book is its excellent balance of theory and practice. While explaining advanced, historically rooted functional concepts—like Lisp’s metaprogramming or Haskell’s type system—Indong demonstrates how they can be immediately applied to real-world TypeScript code. The examples in the book aren’t just simple demos; they are genuine, production-grade solutions to complex problems encountered in real services.
>
> I believe multiparadigm programming is no longer an option but a necessity. That doesn’t mean mixing all paradigms indiscriminately. This book guides you toward understanding the strengths of each paradigm and choosing the right tool for the right situation. Indong’s insight that “object-oriented paradigms solve structural problems, and functional paradigms solve logic problems” clearly stems from extensive trial and error over the years.
>
> I’m certain this book will serve as more than just a technical reference; it will be a guiding light for developers. Anyone can write code, but writing good code is almost an art form. This book is the compass that brings you one step closer to that artistic level.

> This book is far more than a typical technical guide. As an experienced professional, Indong presents complex multiparadigm programming concepts in a way that can be directly applied in real-world scenarios.
>
> Focusing on list processing, the book dives into the essence and practicality of functional programming using TypeScript. By filtering and transforming data and solving problems in a clear, concise manner, it proves that functional programming is no mere theory—it’s a powerful, real-life tool. Notably, it demonstrates how to utilize list processing in backend programming to handle asynchronous tasks, parallel processing, and data manipulation, securing both reliability and scalability.
>
> The book repeatedly reminds us of the importance of “fundamentals” in programming. It clearly shows that even sophisticated features and techniques only shine when built on a solid foundation. Readers are guided through a process of gradual, systematic skill-building. You’ll gain the power not just to write working code, but to craft “good code” that remains true to fundamental principles and structure.
>
> Beyond the multiparadigm concepts, the book offers a concrete look at how to extend language functionality using the iterable protocol and decorator syntax. These techniques provide valuable insights into constructing an efficient environment for problem-solving and will help you develop the ability to create tools that can be used immediately in real-world work.
>
> The content of this book is based on Indong’s extensive experience in the field, solving a variety of problems. Readers can sense how he has tackled complex challenges and how those experiences have deepened his understanding of programming. With this book, you won’t just learn the theory—you’ll discover how to actually apply multiparadigm programming in your day-to-day work.
>
> I’m delighted to recommend this book, which I believe will be a wonderful gift for developers looking to expand their depth in programming.

> I first met Indong when I invited him to give an internal seminar for our company’s developers a few years ago. I’ve hosted countless speakers, but his seminar was hands down one of the most engaging I’ve ever attended. His unique live-coding approach left a strong impression. With live coding, you never know what variable might pop up, yet he skillfully built up each concept step by step, and the sense of excitement and understanding that swept the audience at the pivotal moment is still vivid in my mind. It was the only seminar for which we scheduled an encore session due to overwhelmingly positive feedback, and it remains a truly special memory.
>
> This book contains all the content of that seminar and more. It covers a wide array of practical ways to apply the strengths of both object-oriented and functional programming in real-world settings. Centered on TypeScript, it introduces numerous modern language features and ideas through rich examples, providing insights into how to understand and make use of programming paradigms. From beginners to seasoned experts, anyone aiming to break down paradigm boundaries and write better code will find immense value in its pages.

> I was delighted to hear the news of Indong’s latest publication. He has long been a leading figure in establishing and advocating functional programming in the Korean frontend community, so I was eager to see what topics he would cover this time.
>
> As someone who works daily with colleagues to craft quality code and software—and who has also been teaching FE courses to junior through senior developers for a long time—I’m thrilled to welcome such a high-caliber, practical frontend development book. It will help professionals at every level, from junior developers starting their careers to seasoned veterans, gain deeper insights into programming languages and frontend development. Here are a few key highlights that stood out to me:
>
> 1. The author’s core message that “there are many ways to solve a problem” will resonate with numerous developers. In actual service development, it’s often best to tailor a solution to the situation and context rather than apply a single pattern uniformly. From that perspective, Indong’s balanced combination of object-oriented and functional programming will spark important realizations for many readers.
> 2. You’ll gain a comprehensive understanding of TypeScript (and JavaScript) from multiple perspectives. Beyond the basic syntax of the JavaScript standard API and the TypeScript type system for beginners, the book explores asynchronous programming and advanced error handling rooted in real-world use cases. The author’s extensive frontend and backend experience and philosophy are woven throughout. You’ll get a glimpse of his longstanding contemplation on good code and programming patterns.
> 3. You’ll explore the philosophies and core syntax of various programming languages and experiment with applying them to TypeScript. By examining languages like Lisp and Haskell, then translating those patterns directly into TypeScript, you’ll gain insights into current trends in modern programming languages. You’ll also strengthen your overall programming skills as if you were learning a brand-new language. Throughout the process, you’ll benefit from the author’s deep expertise and practical experience with multiple languages.
>
> There’s much more to mention—real-world code samples, hands-on exercises, final projects, and so on—but I’ll leave them for readers to discover themselves.
>

> I’m truly pleased to write this endorsement. Years ago, I attended an in-house seminar at NAVER on functional programming led by Indong. I vividly recall how I asked him about various problems I’d been wrestling with; he always responded with in-depth answers that helped me learn a lot. The seminar was excellent, but this new book not only encapsulates the contents of that seminar but goes beyond it, offering even deeper insight and material to reflect upon.
>
> Rather than merely presenting theory or techniques, the book encourages you to consider how to understand a problem through multiparadigm thinking and how to use data to solve it. The process naturally incorporates maintainability concerns, leading to better design and implementation—another aspect I found very impressive.
>
> Throughout the book, I felt my own thought process merge seamlessly with the problem-solving steps. From Chapters 1 to 4, I enjoyed learning how to tackle issues using multiparadigm thinking, and I found it intellectually stimulating. From Chapters 5 to 7, I discovered concrete ideas on how to apply these concepts in practice, and I couldn’t wait to try them out in my own projects.
>
> It’s an honor to recommend this book once again, and I sincerely hope that readers will share the same sense of enjoyment and learning that I experienced.
