## 1.1 The Iterator Pattern in OOP and First-Class Functions

One day, while working on functional programming in multiparadigm languages, I realized that the Iterator pattern—one of the classic GoF design patterns I had learned about over a decade ago—lies at the heart of the way modern multiparadigm languages implement functional programming.

Object-oriented languages initially adopted the Iterator pattern to implement lazy iteration protocols, and later introduced first-class functions. These additions led to the creation of various iterator helper methods such as `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `take`. Over time, these helper functions became core features, provided as built-ins in many languages.

So, a design pattern originating from object-oriented programming—the Iterator pattern—has come together with functional programming’s first-class functions to implement lazy evaluation and list processing[^1]. Multiple paradigms, working in tandem, further advanced the functional capabilities of languages, ultimately paving the way for more robust multiparadigm languages.

I think the Iterator pattern was the starting point for this transformation. More than just a single design pattern, it has played an important role in enabling us to utilize multiple paradigms in programming today.

### GoF’s Iterator Pattern

The Iterator pattern is a classic object-oriented design pattern that proposes a protocol for sequentially traversing the elements of a collection. It was introduced in 1994 in the seminal book *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*, authored by the Gang of Four (GoF)[^2].

Below is a TypeScript interface representation of the `Iterator` and related types.

##### [Code 1-1] Iterator Interfaces

```typescript
interface IteratorYieldResult<T> {
  done?: false;
  value: T;
}

interface IteratorReturnResult {
  done: true;
  value: undefined;
}

interface Iterator<T> {
  next(): IteratorYieldResult<T> | IteratorReturnResult;
}
```

1. **`IteratorYieldResult<T>`**
   - Represents a result where `done` is `false` and `value` is of type `T`. This indicates the iterator is not yet finished.

2. **`IteratorReturnResult`**
   - Represents a result where `done` is `true` and `value` is `undefined`. This indicates the iterator has completed.

3. **`Iterator<T>`**
   - An interface with a `next` method that returns either an `IteratorYieldResult<T>` or an `IteratorReturnResult`.

The Iterator pattern allows you to traverse collection elements via a public method like `next()` without exposing the internal structure of the collection. This means you can iterate through any style of collection in a uniform way, regardless of how it’s actually implemented under the hood.

> **Note:** [Code 1-1] has been simplified to convey the main idea. If you paste it directly into a TypeScript editor, you may encounter duplicate type declarations or inference errors. Check out `lib.es2015.iterable.d.ts` for TypeScript’s official `Iterator` interfaces.

### Creating an Iterator from an `ArrayLike` Object

Below is a class that creates an `Iterator` from an `ArrayLike` object. While you could implement this more succinctly using functions and object literals, we’re taking a more traditional OOP approach here. We also aren’t using the JavaScript iteration protocol; in this chapter, we want to focus on how OOP languages themselves adopted functional paradigms, beginning with the Iterator pattern.

##### [Code 1-2] A Class That Creates an Iterator from `ArrayLike`

```typescript
/* lib.es5.ts
interface ArrayLike<T> {
  readonly length: number;
  readonly [n: number]: T;
} 
*/

class ArrayLikeIterator<T> implements Iterator<T> {
  private index = 0;
  constructor(private arrayLike: ArrayLike<T>) {}
  
  next(): IteratorResult<T> {
    if (this.index < this.arrayLike.length) {
      return {
        value: this.arrayLike[this.index++],
        done: false
      };
    } else {
      return {
        value: undefined,
        done: true
      };
    }
  }
}

const arrayLike: ArrayLike<number> = { 
  0: 10, 
  1: 20, 
  2: 30, 
  length: 3 
};

const iterator: Iterator<number> = new ArrayLikeIterator(arrayLike);

console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 10, done: false }
console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 20, done: false }
console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 30, done: false }
console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: undefined, done: true }
```

`ArrayLikeIterator` follows the GoF’s Iterator pattern. It supports a collection of type `ArrayLike`, meaning that it has a `length` property and zero-based numeric keys. In JavaScript, many types fit this description—such as `Array`, `arguments`, and `NodeList`. Thus, `ArrayLikeIterator` doesn’t just work with arrays, but with any collection that meets these conditions.

##### [Code 1-3] Using `ArrayLikeIterator` with an Array

```typescript
const array: Array<string> = ["a", "b", "c"];
const iterator2: Iterator<string> = new ArrayLikeIterator(array);

console.log(iterator2.next()); // { value: 'a', done: false }
console.log(iterator2.next()); // { value: 'b', done: false }
console.log(iterator2.next()); // { value: 'c', done: false }
console.log(iterator2.next()); // { value: undefined, done: true }
```

By calling `iterator.next()`, we traverse the elements of both `arrayLike` and `array`. Notice that an element is accessed only when `next()` is called. This property allows us to implement lazy evaluation[^3] with an iterator.

### Creating a Reverse Iterator Function from an `ArrayLike` Object

Next, we’ll create an iterator that traverses array elements in reverse order. Let’s start by reviewing the `reverse` method of arrays.

#### The `reverse` Method in Arrays

When you call `array.reverse()`, the original array is immediately reversed in place. In [Code 1-4], the order of elements is already changed by the time we try to access the array with an index.

##### [Code 1-4] `array.reverse()`

```typescript
const array = ['A', 'B'];
array.reverse(); // Reverses the array in place
console.log(array[0], array[1]); // B A
```

While this behavior might seem natural, for large data sets or performance-critical applications, the overhead of rearranging the entire array can be costly.

#### Using Iterator’s Lazy Properties to Create a `reverse` Function

By leveraging an iterator, you can traverse an array in reverse without actually reversing it. An iterator performs "lazy evaluation," retrieving one element at a time only when needed. This avoids unnecessary operations and memory usage by deferring work until it’s actually required.

##### [Code 1-5] A `reverse` Function That Returns an Iterator

```typescript
function reverse<T>(arrayLike: ArrayLike<T>): Iterator<T> {
  let idx = arrayLike.length;
  return {
    next() {
      if (idx-- >= 0) {
        return { value: arrayLike[idx], done: false };
      } else {
        return { value: undefined, done: true };
      }
    }
  };
}

const array = ['A', 'B'];
const reversed = reverse(array);
console.log(array); // ['A', 'B'] (the original array remains unchanged)

console.log(reversed.next().value, reversed.next().value);
// B A
```

In [Code 1-5], the `reverse` function takes an `ArrayLike` object and returns an iterator that can traverse it in reverse order—without modifying the original. While it’s nice that the original array remains unchanged, the bigger benefit is that nothing happens at the moment of calling `reverse`. Each element is retrieved in reverse order only when `reversed.next().value` is called.

#### The Efficiency of Lazy Evaluation

Comparing [Code 1-4] and [Code 1-5] alone may not fully illustrate the benefits of lazy evaluation, but consider the scenario in [Code 1-6].

##### [Code 1-6] When Lazy Evaluation Is More Efficient

```typescript
const array = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'];
array.reverse(); // Immediately reverses the entire array
console.log(array); // ['F', 'E', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'A']
console.log(array[0], array[1]); // F E

const array2 = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'];
const reversed = reverse(array2);
console.log(array2); // ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
console.log(reversed.next().value, reversed.next().value); // F E
```

By using `reverse(array2)`, only the elements you actually need (`F`, `E`) are accessed in reverse order. This can reduce operations and memory usage, especially for large collections.

##### [Code 1-7] If You Need the Original Array, Too

```typescript
const array = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'];
const reversed = [...array].reverse(); // Copy the entire array before reversing
console.log(reversed[0], reversed[1], array[0], array[1]);
// F E A B

const array2 = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'];
const reversed2 = reverse(array2);
console.log(reversed2.next().value, reversed2.next().value, array2[0], array2[1]);
// F E A B
```

In the first case, you copy the entire array to keep the original, then reverse the copy. In the second, you never need to copy because the original is never changed in the first place.

### A Lazy-Evaluating `map` Function

[Code 1-8] shows a lazy `map` function that takes an `Iterator<A>` and a function that transforms `A` to `B`, returning a new `Iterator<B>`.

1. **First-Class Functions**
   - The `map` function takes `transform` as an argument, treating functions as values that can be passed around. This ability is a defining characteristic of first-class functions and enables higher-order functions.

2. **Higher-Order Functions**
   - A higher-order function accepts one or more functions as arguments or returns a function. Because `map` accepts a function as its argument, it’s a textbook example of a higher-order function.

Such first-class and higher-order functions are core components of the functional programming paradigm, making logic easier to modularize and combine.

##### [Code 1-8] A `map` Function That Takes `Iterator<A>` and Returns `Iterator<B>`

```typescript
function map<A, B>(transform: (value: A) => B, iterator: Iterator<A>): Iterator<B> {
  return {
    next(): IteratorResult<B> {
      const { value, done } = iterator.next();
      return done
        ? { value, done }
        : { value: transform(value), done };
    }
  };
}
```

Just like `reverse`, the `map` function does nothing until its `next` method is called. When called, it in turn calls `iterator.next()`. If `done` is `true`, it simply returns that result; if `done` is `false`, it applies `transform` to `value` and returns the transformed result.

##### [Code 1-9] `map(f, reverse(array))`

```typescript
const array = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'];
const iterator = map(str => str.toLowerCase(), reverse(array));
console.log(iterator.next().value, iterator.next().value); // f e
```

`reverse(array)` creates an iterator that yields items in reverse order, while `map` applies the transformation `str => str.toLowerCase()` to each item. In [Code 1-9], only the first two items are processed because `next()` is called only twice.

When an iterator pattern offers lazy traversal and first-class functions enable higher-order functions, combining them yields advanced list processing methods like `map`, `filter`, `take`, and `reduce`—all supporting lazy evaluation.

In summary, we’ve seen how we can use the lazy nature of the Iterator pattern to defer function execution. We’ll continue to explore how the Iterator pattern, first-class functions, generators, and the iteration protocol come together, shedding light on how different paradigms interrelate within multiparadigm languages.

> In the following sections, I’ll offer a brief look at this book’s overall storyline on multiparadigm. If some concepts or technologies feel unfamiliar, feel free to return to this text after finishing Chapter 1.

### The Crossroads of Multiparadigm: The Iterator Pattern and First-Class Functions

Starting with ES6, JavaScript standardized the `Iterator` protocol across all core collection types—such as `Map`, `Set`, `Array`, and `NodeList`—ensuring a unified iteration framework. The iteration protocol works seamlessly with `for...of` loops, the spread operator, and destructuring, and ES6 also introduced generator functions that produce `IterableIterator`s. Iteration and generators played a big role in JavaScript’s ES6 overhaul, and they continue to evolve: features like `AsyncGenerator`, `Array.fromAsync`, and the future Iterator Helpers show that the protocol is still advancing.

ES6 also introduced `class` syntax, significantly expanding JavaScript’s object-oriented capabilities. At the time, I was deeply interested in functional programming and paid less attention to these OOP changes. However, while building products and open-source libraries using the iteration protocol, I came to see that modern programming languages—JavaScript, TypeScript, and beyond—use the Iterator pattern, an OOP design pattern, as a central backbone for functional programming features.

What’s more interesting is that this traditional, object-oriented design pattern meets functional programming’s first-class functions in a way that amplifies their strengths. In addition, the imperative style in generators also fits right in, showing that these three paradigms—object-oriented, functional, and imperative—can coexist and reinforce one another within a single language, making it genuinely multiparadigm. Revisiting and rewriting OOP code I used to love highlighted the benefits of object-oriented programming, and opened my eyes to the future direction of modern language development.

Coming full circle, I view the Iterator pattern and first-class functions as the entry points for the intersection of these three paradigms. My goal for this book is to demonstrate practical ways to fully leverage multiparadigm language features. In this opening chapter, we’ve explored the appeal of the Iterator pattern while weaving a bit of storytelling around multiparadigm languages.

The most fascinating aspect is that the Iterator pattern didn’t originate as a built-in language feature; it’s an implementation proposed by the authors of *Design Patterns*—the Gang of Four—rather than by language designers themselves. While GoF’s design patterns are rooted in object-oriented thinking, they share something in common with Lisp’s philosophy[^4] that developers should be able to update their language immediately.

Functional programming, object-oriented programming, and design patterns each have a long theoretical history and a wealth of real-world experience behind them. More than just coding methodologies, they represent a collective body of knowledge that has tackled a wide range of problems throughout the history of software. Understanding these practices deeply can give you proven principles and abundant insights for solving new challenges.

I hope this book helps you dive into the solid, long-evolving techniques and rich stories of the software engineering world.
