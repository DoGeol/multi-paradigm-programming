## 3.5 Summary

### Code:Object:Function = Generator:Iterator:LISP = IP:OOP:FP

“Code, object, function” can each be viewed through the lens of “generator, iterator, LISP,” respectively. An **iterator** is the implementation of the Iterator pattern, an object that traverses collection values in a generalized manner. Because an iterator is **lazy**, it executes only as far as it needs and can pause execution. This makes it possible to create iterators that could, in principle, be consumed indefinitely. Consequently, combining imperative, object-oriented, and functional paradigms yields a powerful programming model.

### Code as Data: A Logic-Bearing List

The philosophy of Lisp reflects a programming language paradigm that blurs the boundary between code and data. In Lisp’s S-expressions, logic is represented as a list, enabling code to be more flexible and extensible. The LISP concept can be applied to modern programming languages, by treating code and data as one and the same. LISP's metaprogramming capability makes it possible to treat code and data identically, allowing them to be dynamically generated and manipulated. Through this, programmers can write more flexible and powerful programs.

### Learning from Haskell

Haskell is a purely functional programming language that provides pure functions, function composition, currying, lazy evaluation, and a robust type system. Studying Haskell offers insight into functional programming concepts and how to apply them in modern languages. Its function signatures and pattern matching strengthen both code safety and readability. In particular, Haskell’s powerful type system can infer types without explicit annotations, helping developers write safe yet concise code.

### A Closer Look at Lazy Evaluation

**Lazy evaluation** is a strategy in which computations are deferred until absolutely necessary, helping optimize performance. Through practical implementations and application examples of lazy evaluation, we can write more efficient code. It is an important concept for performance optimization and resource conservation, enabling us to create better programs. Lazy evaluation is particularly useful in processing large-scale data and complex calculations, as it performs computations only when needed, reducing unnecessary resource waste.

### Generator:Iterator:LISP – Lazy Evaluation and Safe Composition

We’ve seen that we can implement higher-order functions like `find`, `every`, and `some` purely by combining list-processing functions. In TypeScript, operators such as the optional chaining operator (`?.`) and the non-null assertion operator (`!`) let us handle potentially missing values in a safe and expressive manner. Meanwhile, list-processing functions remain efficient through lazy evaluation, and functional design makes it easy to abstract out common logic to eliminate duplication.
