## Environment Setup and Example Code

### Official GitHub Page

All the TypeScript examples from this book can be found in the following GitHub repository:

- GitHub: https://github.com/marpple/multi-paradigm-ts

The repository includes everything needed to run the examples, such as installation instructions, `tsconfig.json` settings, and required packages. By simply following the setup process, you can quickly run the examples provided in the book.

### Tips for Learning with Example Code

While the example code is fully prepared, we encourage you to create new files in the same environment and write the code yourself. By writing and running the code while referring to the book, you can achieve a deeper and more effective learning experience.

### Additional Resources and Information

The official GitHub page also provides updates on various resources, such as video lectures that align with the book's content, links to online communities for collaborative learning, and a YouTube channel. If you’re interested, feel free to visit the GitHub repository for more information.
